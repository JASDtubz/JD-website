          Why are we here?

          I sometimes have the worst thoughts about the universe.
          For example, why do we need to be here?
          Is there any meaning to why we need to survive?
          Religion does give us some answers, but in today's society, nothing is answered besides pleasure and wealth.
          And because of that, are atheists and nihilists right?
          Should we just drop things that science has ruled out to be absurd and live life to the fullest?
          Well my opinion on this is probably well hated, but here it is.
          All non-religious people are living meaningless lives.
          First of all, if we are to believe science, the universe will be inhospitable for life someday in the far future.
          So that means the logical end goal for humanity is to beat the system and find a way to survive by breaking the universe itself.
          The previous sentence probably sounds nonsense, but if we are to believe in science, that is the only thing we can do to survive.
          While in religions, some of them have the concepts of after life and that it is okay if humanity can not survive the heat death of the universe.
          But that is another thing.
          What is death?
          What is consciousness?
          I know that it is going to seem like I am jumping from one thing to another, but this is going to be like a rough draft paper and will not be revised at all.
          So please bear with me.
          In science, we believe that everything should be able to be predicted in some way based on equations.
          Right now, we might not know everything about how atoms and molecules behave, but we have good guesses and theories.
          And if we are able to understand the forces that govern our universe so well to the point that we can predict what a certain group of atoms will do in an hour, that means we can finally get to understanding ourselves and how we are to be.
          But with quantum theory, it says there is randomness in everything.
          But going back to the real picture, in short, if you believe in science then you do not have free will.
          Because then everything can be explained by molecules interacting with other molecules.
          After all, proteins are just really big molecules.
          So every thought, every action, every word you say, can basically be predicted if you know what every atom in your body is going to do.
          But if you do not believe that is the case, then the concept of a soul would fit the position of 'free will'.
          One other conclusion I came up with is that if you want everybody to be happy, you should wipe out the population of the earth.
          I am getting this from equality and how much suffering there is in the world.
          It is okay if you do not know how much unfairness, pain, suffering, death and more are in this world, but I have seen just a small sliver of it.
          And let me tell you, this world is full of evil.
          And the saying goes, "I didn't ask to be born," fits well because who wants to suffer?
          So the only somewhat logical conclusion is to purge all of humanity because then no one will have to suffer.
          But what about the religious views?
          Some religions require us to suffer in order to reach our full selves.
          But there is no reason on the scientific side.
          I guess this is why suicide rates are high because they no longer wish to suffer.
          This was a poorly written rant and I will probably have a better version in part 2, but these are just some of my points on why being religious will keep us from worrying about the future.
          And reasoning from the atheist to nihilist side will only lead us to worthless lives.
